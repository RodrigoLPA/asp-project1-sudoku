# ASP Project 1: Sudoku solver

*Problem Description:* The task of this project is to solve a Sudoku puzzle using ASP.
The goal of the game is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and
each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all numbers from 1 to 9. In
other words, the grid has to be filled with numbers from 1 to 9 so that the same number
does not appear twice in the same row, column or in any of the nine 3x3 sub-grids of the
9x9 playing board. Initially the grid is partially filled.
